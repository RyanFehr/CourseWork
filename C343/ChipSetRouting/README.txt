*findPaths - Performs a normal bfs search or shortest distance bfs on the chipset
*runBFS - This calls bfs and selects the shortest path for each start end pair in numerical order
*runShortestDistance - This calls bfs and selects the shortest path for the start end pairs with the shortest distance between them first
*bfs - The function that performs the actual breadth first search and returns a list of all paths from the start point
*getPath- This method will select the shortest path to the destination of the paths given to it
*distanceTo - Calculates the distance between two coordinates
*rearrage - arranges the input points in order of smallest to largest distance
*re_rearrange - arranges the list of paths for wires by their numerical start point ascending
